# Biomaker CA

This repository contains the code for Biomaker CA.

For an explanation of the project, see [this web article](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/2023/biomaker-ca/) or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09320).
For video explanations and tutorial, see the [Making Life YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MakingLifeYT).

Note that for important releases, such as papers or videos, we may freeze the
code base and use a specific release tag to load the appropriate version.

Currently, to reproduce the work of the original paper, one must git install by
fetching the tag: 'biomaker-v1.0.0'. The related colabs have already this tag in
place.
